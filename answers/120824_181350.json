"{\"answer\": \"LLM evaluation is crucial for understanding how well a language model performs. It helps developers identify strengths and weaknesses, ensuring the model functions effectively in real-world applications. There are two main types of evaluation:\\n\\n* **Model evaluation** assesses the core abilities of the LLM itself.\\n* **System evaluation** looks at how it performs within a specific program or with user input.\\n\\nKey evaluation metrics include:\\n\\n* **Response completeness and conciseness:** Determines if the LLM response fully addresses the user query and is relevant.\\n* **Text similarity metrics:** Compare generated text to a reference, gauging similarity and performance.\\n* **Question answering accuracy:** Measures how well an LLM answers questions based on factual correctness.\\n* **Relevance:** Determines the relevancy of an LLM's response to a prompt or question.\\n* **Hallucination index:** Identifies how much an LLM fabricates information or provides biased output.\\n* **Toxicity:** Determines the percentage of offensive or harmful language in the output.\\n* **Task-specific metrics:** Specialized metrics for specific tasks like summarization or translation.\\n\\nLLM evaluation frameworks and tools provide standardized benchmarks to measure and improve model performance, reliability, and fairness. Some examples include:\\n\\n* **DeepEval:** An open-source framework for quantifying LLM performance on metrics like contextual recall, answer relevance, and faithfulness.\\n* **promptfoo:** A CLI and library for evaluating LLM output quality and performance, enabling systematic testing of prompts and models.\\n* **EleutherAI LM Eval:** Few-shot evaluation and performance across various tasks with minimal fine-tuning.\\n* **MMLU:** An LLM evaluation framework testing models on a wide range of subjects with zero-shot and one-shot settings.\\n* **BLEU (BiLingual Evaluation Understudy):** Measures the similarity of machine-translated text to reference translations, ranging from 0 to 1.\\n* **SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset):** A dataset for evaluating LLMs for question-answering tasks, including context passages, questions, and associated answers.\\n* **OpenAI Evals:** A standard framework for evaluating LLMs by OpenAI, with an open-source registry of benchmarks. This framework tests LLM models to ensure accuracy.\\n* **UpTrain:** An open-source LLM evaluation tool providing pre-built metrics to check LLM responses on aspects like correctness, hallucination, and toxicity.\\n* **H2O LLM EvalGPT:** An open tool for understanding a model's performance across various tasks and benchmarks.\"} {\"answer\": \"Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial to determine their quality and usefulness in various applications. Several frameworks have been developed to evaluate LLMs, but none of them are comprehensive enough to cover all aspects of language understanding. \\n\\nHere are some of the major existing evaluation frameworks:\\n\\n* **Big Bench:** Evaluates generalization abilities. (https://github.com/google/BIG-bench)\\n* **GLUE Benchmark:** Evaluates grammar, paraphrasing, text similarity, inference, textual entailment, resolving pronoun references. (https://gluebenchmark.com/)\\n* **SuperGLUE Benchmark:** Evaluates natural language understanding, reasoning, understanding complex sentences beyond training data, coherent and well-formed natural language generation, dialogue with human beings, common sense reasoning, information retrieval, reading comprehension. (https://super.gluebenchmark.com/)\\n* **OpenAI Moderation API:** Filters out harmful or unsafe content. (https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/moderations)\\n* **MMLU:** Evaluates language understanding across various tasks and domains. (https://github.com/hendrycks/test)\\n* **EleutherAI LM Eval:** Evaluates few-shot evaluation and performance in a wide range of tasks with minimal fine-tuning. (https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness)\\n* **OpenAI Evals:** Evaluates accuracy, diversity, consistency, robustness, transferability, efficiency, fairness of text generated. (https://github.com/openai/evals)\\n* **Adversarial NLI (ANLI):** Evaluates robustness, generalization, coherent explanations for inferences, consistency of reasoning across similar examples, efficiency in terms of resource usage (memory usage, inference time, and training time). (https://github.com/facebookresearch/anli)\\n* **LIT (Language Interpretability Tool):** Platform to evaluate on user-defined metrics. Provides insights into their strengths, weaknesses, and potential biases. (https://pair-code.github.io/lit/)\\n* **ParlAI:** Evaluates accuracy, F1 score, perplexity (how well the model predicts the next word in a sequence), human evaluation on criteria like relevance, fluency, and coherence, speed & resource utilization, robustness (evaluates performance under different conditions such as noisy inputs, adversarial attacks, or varying levels of data quality), generalization. (https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI)\\n* **CoQA:** Evaluates understanding a text passage and answering a series of interconnected questions that appear in a conversation. (https://stanfordnlp.github.io/coqa/)\\n* **LAMBADA:** Evaluates long-term understanding using prediction of the last word of a passage. (https://zenodo.org/record/2630551#.ZFUKS-zML0p)\\n* **HellaSwag:** Evaluates reasoning abilities. (https://rowanzellers.com/hellaswag/)\\n* **LogiQA:** Evaluates logical reasoning abilities. (https://github.com/lgw863/LogiQA-dataset)\\n* **MultiNLI:** Evaluates understanding relationships between sentences across different genres. (https://cims.nyu.edu/~sbowman/multinli/)\\n* **SQUAD:** Evaluates reading comprehension tasks. (https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/)\\n\\nWhen evaluating LLMs, it is important to consider factors such as authenticity, speed, grammar and readability, unbiasedness, backtracking, safety & responsibility, understanding the context, text operations, IQ, EQ, versatility, real-time update, cost, consistency, and the extent of prompt engineering.\"}"

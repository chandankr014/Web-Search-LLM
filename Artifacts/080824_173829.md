content="The provided context explains the formation and composition of Village Water and Sanitation Committees (VWSCs) within the Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM). \n\n**How VWSCs are formed:**\n\nThe formation of VWSCs is a community-driven process. The JJM encourages the active participation of villagers in the planning, implementation, and management of their water supply systems. The process typically involves:\n\n1. **Community Mobilization:**  The JJM promotes awareness and understanding of the mission's goals and the role of VWSCs in achieving them. This involves meetings, workshops, and information dissemination within the village.\n2. **Selection of Members:** The community comes together to select representatives for the VWSC. This selection process should be inclusive, ensuring representation from different social groups, including women, marginalized communities, and youth.\n3. **Formalization of the Committee:** Once the members are selected, the VWSC is formally constituted. This may involve registering the committee with the local authorities.\n\n**Composition of a VWSC:**\n\nThe composition of a VWSC can vary based on the village's specific needs and structure. However, it typically includes:\n\n* **Elected Representatives:**  The Sarpanch (village head), UpSarpanch (deputy village head), and Gram Panchayat (village council) members are included to ensure coordination with the district-level authorities (DWSM) for JJM implementation.\n* **Traditional Leaders:**  The inclusion of traditional village heads or senior leaders brings valuable local knowledge and experience to the committee, ensuring the water supply system aligns with the community's needs and traditions.\n* **Other Village Members:**  The VWSC should have representatives from diverse social groups, including women, marginalized communities, and youth. This ensures the committee is truly representative of the village and that all voices are heard.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM):** A government program in India aiming to provide clean water to every rural household by 2024. It emphasizes community participation, infrastructure development, and sustainable water management.\n* **Village Water and Sanitation Committees (VWSCs):** Community-based committees responsible for planning, implementing, operating, and maintaining water supply systems in their villages.\n* **Functional Household Tap Connection (FHTC):** The JJM's goal of providing a safe and reliable water connection to every rural household.\n\n**In summary:** VWSCs are formed through a community-driven process, with members selected to represent diverse sections of the village. The committee's composition ensures inclusivity and local expertise, empowering communities to take ownership of their water supply systems and manage them effectively and sustainably. \n" response_metadata={'prompt_feedback': {'block_reason': 0, 'safety_ratings': []}, 'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'safety_ratings': [{'category': 'HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT', 'probability': 'NEGLIGIBLE', 'blocked': False}, {'category': 'HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH', 'probability': 'NEGLIGIBLE', 'blocked': False}, {'category': 'HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT', 'probability': 'NEGLIGIBLE', 'blocked': False}, {'category': 'HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT', 'probability': 'NEGLIGIBLE', 'blocked': False}]} id='run-9186ef9e-fb6e-4285-82ea-2b497205e612-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 791, 'output_tokens': 548, 'total_tokens': 1339}
